## 🔥 Key Claims vs. Reality

| Claim | Truth Check |
|-------|-------------|
| FEMA said "no money" for Maui | Initial aid provided; long-term funds delayed due to congressional inaction |
| FEMA ignored East Palestine | FEMA offered coordination help, but residents weren't eligible for direct grants |
| No funds for Western NC flooding | FEMA responded; rumors of no funding debunked |
| FEMA gave $1B to immigrants | FALSE. No disaster relief funds were diverted to migrants |
